The following is taken from his campaign website: \n\nhttps://joebiden.com/governmentreform\n\n\u201cBiden strongly believes that we could improve our politics overnight if we flushed big money from the system and had public financing of our elections. Democracy works best when a big bank account or a large donor list are not prerequisites for office, and elected representatives come from all backgrounds, regardless of resources. But for too long, special interests and corporations have skewed the policy process in their favor with political contributions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIntroduce a constitutional amendment to entirely eliminate private dollars from our federal elections. Biden believes it is long past time to end the influence of private dollars in our federal elections. As president, Biden will fight for a constitutional amendment that will require candidates for federal office to solely fund their campaigns with public dollars, and prevent outside spending from distorting the election process.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnact legislation to provide voluntary matching public funds for federal candidates receiving small dollar donations. While we work toward a constitutional amendment, meaningful change can be made by legislation. Biden will propose legislation to provide public matching funds for small dollar donations to all federal candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep foreign money out of our elections. Biden will propose a law to strengthen our prohibitions on foreign nationals trying to influence federal, state, or local elections.  He will direct a new independent agency, the Commission on Federal Ethics (discussed in detail below), to assure vigorous and unified enforcement of this and other anti-corruption laws. The Commission will establish robust disclosure requirements, so that any online electioneering communication that originates abroad is identified and flagged.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmpower agency watchdogs to combat unethical behavior.  Biden will strengthen Inspectors General laws \u2014 which established watchdogs in nearly every Executive Branch agency \u2014 to give IGs the full subpoena power and independence they need to investigate and publicize any official\u2019s actual or attempted improper conduct. Inspectors General must be given the express authority to prevent, investigate, and disclose all violations.\u201d\n\n\u201cProhibit improper interference in agency matters.  Biden will ensure that agency decisions on specific matters, like awarding government contracts or granting government permits, are based on merit and expertise, not on political preferences. Biden will issue an Executive Order prohibiting anyone in the White House from interfering with federal agencies on these matters, and he will require the White House to disclose to the public if any corporation, individual, or other entity tries to solicit White House help.  This information will be aggregated and made public by the Commission on Federal Ethics.\u201d  \n\n\u201cEmpower DOJ to enforce the law. Biden will ensure that DOJ has the resources and authority to enforce our laws, including those the Trump Administration has told career prosecutors and agents to ignore \u2013 laws that protect our voting rights, make discrimination illegal, and protect the environment. And, Biden will re-commit the Department\u2019s Civil Rights and Energy and Natural Resources divisions to their missions.\u201d  \n\n\u201cEstablish the Commission on Federal Ethics to more effectively enforce federal ethics law. Biden will propose and enact legislation establishing a single government agency empowered to oversee and enforce federal anti-corruption and ethics laws. Today, existing law is a patchwork of subject-matter-specific mandates, overseen by agencies that often lack the authority to demand and receive compliance.

See the full response below.",source:"In response to our request for his plan in this area, the Sanders campaign sent the following: \n\n\"Filibuster:\n \nAs was the case with workers\u2019 rights, the civil rights movement, the women\u2019s movement, the gay rights movement and the environmental movement, the only way transformational change happens is when millions of people stand up and demand it. \n\nBefore we even get to the issue of the filibuster, we need 50 senators who are prepared to do what we, as a nation, have a moral obligation to accomplish -and that is to pass the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and other major reforms we need.\n\nOnce we have, and I believe it will be sooner than later, a Democratic majority that is prepared to take on the greed and the corruption of the fossil fuel industry and vote for these major reforms in the House and the Senate, we will pass them. That means enacting real filibuster reform, including the return to requiring a talking filibuster. It is not right that one Senator can grind the entire legislative process to a halt.\n\nFurther, the budget reconciliation process, with 50 votes, has been used time and time again to pass major pieces of legislation. Under our Constitution and the rules of the Senate, it is the vice president who determines what is and is not permissible under budget reconciliation. While a president does not have the power to abolish the filibuster, I can tell you that a vice president in a Bernie Sanders administration will determine that a Green New Deal and Medicare for All can pass through the Senate under reconciliation and is not in violation of the rules.\n\nRestoring voting rights for people with felony convictions:\n\nThe truth is that our country has had a long and shameful history of voter suppression. When we look at the history of why our country has banned incarcerated people from voting, we must understand that the efforts to rob citizens of their voting rights was a legacy of slavery and continuing racist attitudes post-Jim Crow. After the ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, which extended civil and legal protections to formerly enslaved people, many state governments rushed to create new felonies to put black people in jail and then institute lifetime disenfranchisement as a way to protect their own privilege and power.\n\nThis should not devolve into a debate about whether certain people are \u201cgood enough\u201d to have the right to vote. Voting is not a privilege. It is a right. What I believe is if you've committed a crime and you're in jail, you're paying a price. But you're still a member of American society and that means you have a right to vote.\n\nIn my home state of Vermont, in Maine, in Puerto Rico and in over 30 democracies around the world, the right to vote cannot be taken away even for those who are incarcerated. \n\nIf we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we must firmly establish that the right to vote is an inalienable and universal principle that applies to all American citizens 18 years and older. Period. As American citizens, all of us are entitled to freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly and all the other freedoms enshrined in our Bill of Rights. We are also entitled to vote. At a time when voting suppression is taking place all across the country, we must make it clear that casting a ballot for American citizens is not a privilege. It is a right. If you\u2019re an American citizen who is 18 years or older you must be able to vote, whether you're in jail or not.\n\nExpanding the Voting Rights Act, Ending voter suppression, Eliminating Gerrymandering: \n\nI believe that every American, regardless of income, race, disability, identity, or background must have the freedom to exercise their constitutional right to vote.\n\nToday we are faced with a crisis of voter suppression. Our democracy is stronger when we make it easier, not harder, for people to vote. We must combat voter suppression by cowardly politicians in every state.\n\nWhat we have to be about is expanding our democracy, and ensuring that every American citizen has the right to vote, period.\n\nTo make sure every voter counts, I will:\n\n\u25cfSecure automatic voter registration for every American over 18.\n\n\u25cfEnd racist voter suppression and partisan gerrymandering.\n\n\u25cfRestore theVoting Rights Act.\n\n\u25cfRe-enfranchise the millions of Americans who have had their right to vote taken away by a felony conviction, including those currently incarcerated, as voting is a fundamental American right. What Bernies believes is if you've committeda crime and you're in jail, you're paying a price. But you're still a member of American society and that means you have a right to vote.\n\n\u25cfEnding prison gerrymandering, ensuring incarcerated people are counted in their communities, not where they are incarcerated.\n\n\u25cfAbolish burdensome voter ID laws.\n\n\u25cfMake Election Day a national holiday.\n\n\u25cfAbolish the Electoral College.\n\n\u25cfEnsure voting is fully accessible for people with disabilities.\n\n\u25cfPass the For the People Act to expand early voting and also make absentee voting easier.\n\nEnding special interest influence and political corruption:\n\nOur grassroots-funded campaign is proving every single day that you don't need billionaires and private fundraisers to run for president. We've received more contributions from more individual contributors than any campaign in the history of American politics because we understand the basic reality that you can't take on a corrupt system if you take its money. Working people all over the country are responding to that message and demanding a political revolution through their small dollar donations. When we win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump, we will transform our political system by rejecting the influence of big corporate money. \n\nI recently released a planto end the greed-fueled, corrupt corporate influence over elections, national party convention, and presidential inaugurations. \n\nIn 2016, seventeen donors gave three-quarters of the Democratic National Convention funding, with large corporations like Comcast, Bank of America and Facebook donating millions. At the 2013 Presidential inauguration, corporate donors including, AT&T, Microsoft, and Chevron donated millions. \n\nAs the Democratic nominee, I will ban all corporate contributions to the Democratic Party Convention and all related committees, and as President I will ban all corporate donations for inaugural events and cap individual donations at $500. \n\nAdditionally, my plan would abolish the now-worthless FEC and replace it with the  Federal Election Administration, a true law enforcement agency originally proposed by former Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold. \n\nOther key elements my Money Out of Politics Plan (https://berniesanders.com/issues/money-out-of-politics/) include:\n\n\u25cfEnacting mandatory public financing laws for all federal elections. \n\n\u25cfUpdating and strengthen the Federal Election Campaign Act to return to a system of mandatory public funding for National Party Conventions. \n\n\u25cfPassing a Constitutional Amendment that makes clear that money is not speech and corporations are not people.\n\n\u25cfEnding the influence of corporations at the DNC.\n\n\u25cfBanning donations from federal lobbyists and corporations. \n\n\u25cfInstitute a lifetime lobbying ban for National Party Chairs and Co-Chairs\n\n\u25cfBanning Chairs and Co-Chairs from working for entities with federal contract, that are seeking government approval for projects or mergers, or can reasonably be expected to have business before Congress in the future. \n\n\u25cfBanning advertising during presidential primary debates.\n\n\u25cfInstituting a lifetime lobbying ban for former members of Congress and senior staffers\"\n"},warren:{score:"7",analysis:"Senator Warren\u2019s robust and comprehensive anti-corruption plans, alongside her commitment to strengthening our democracy through expanding and guaranteeing the right to vote, her strong advocacy for abolishing the filibuster, and other measures make her a clear leader in this category.

Huge fossil fuel corporations influenced our government, paralyzing democracy and accelerating the catastrophic impacts of a rapidly warming planet. A central goal of my campaign is to root out corruption in our government sothat it can serve the interests of everyone, not just those of billionaires, lobbyists, and big corporations.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate. It\u2019s an aggressive set of reforms that would fundamentally change the way Washington does business: ending lobbying as we know it by slamming shut the revolving door between industry and government, reducing industry\u2019s ability to influence the regulatory process, and ensuring that the rules proposed by our environmental agencies reflect the needs of all communities, not the fossil fuel industry. My \u200banti-corruption proposal\u200b (https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/end-washington-corruption) tackles the influence of money -- and the lack of transparency around it -- in government head on. Elected officials and senior agency officials would be banned from owning or trading any individual stocks while in office, and everyone who runs for federal office would be required to put their taxes online for the public to see. Our government should be working for working families, not the wealthy and well-connected. And I have pledged to eliminate the filibuster, because we cannot afford to put small-minded partisanship ahead of solving climate change and the massive problems we face in this country.\n\nMy plan would also work to restore faith that ordinary people get a fair shake in our courts. That means strengthening the code of conduct for federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, to prohibit stock trading, payment by corporations to attend events, receive gifts for giving speeches, or go on fancy hunting trips and lavish getaways funded by billionaires. It also means increasing the racial, gender, and professional diversity of the federal judiciary to ensure ourcommunities are appropriately represented by their legal system.\n\nI also have a plan to \u200bstrengthen our democracy\u200b (https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/strengthening-democracy) and make voting easy, convenient and fair. We need a constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to vote. But we can also take action now. The federal government has the power to regulate federal elections, secure our democracy, and end racist voter suppression. I\'ll start by modernizing federal elections withsecure, state-of-the-art machines and ballots. Next, I\u2019ll make Election Day a national holiday and establish federal standards to ensure everyone can vote, mandating automatic and same-day registration, early voting, and vote by mail. I\u2019ll provide incentives and resources for states to improve state elections, as well as consequences for those racist or corrupt politicians who refuse to follow the law. Finally, the Electoral College will be replaced by a national popular vote, because everyone\u2019s vote should count equally -- in every election -- no matter where they live.\n\nThis also means re-enfranchising those who\u2019ve served their time in prison. Once someone has paid their debt to society, they\u2019re expected to pay taxes, abide by the law, and support themselves and their families. I think that should also mean they should be able to reclaim their right to vote.\n\nCorruption in Washington is holding back progress\u2014and much of it is perfectly legal thanks tothe Supreme Court. It\u2019s time to take big money out of politics and put it back where it belongs --with the people. We must start by passing a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s disastrous decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo, as well as pass new campaign finance laws to shut down corruption and expand disclosure of fundraising and spending. We also need to bring dark money into the light by requiring additional disclosures by presidential campaigns and updating laws for online political advertising. Lastly, we need to establish a public financing program that gives a 6-1 match for small dollar contributions to candidates and parties and lower limits for how much individuals can contribute to campaigns in order to democratize political participation."'}},{title:"Plan for federal and administrative reform measures",description:"Plan for reform of federal agencies, rulemaking, and administrative structure to support an economic mobilization of the size and speed required by the GND.",total:"7",biden:{score:"0",analysis:"The Biden campaign did not submit a response to this question or any questions on the Plan To Win section, and we couldn\u2019t find any significant details on his plans to reform agencies or rulemaking to enact a mobilization on the size and speed of the Green New Deal.",source:""},sanders:{score:"5",analysis:"Senator Sanders\u2019 plan for reform of federal agencies includes the cooperation of several executive agencies to lead a task force for the phasing out of fossil fuels.

In order to make the carbon pollution reductions required by the IPCC report, we must eliminate all new fossil fuel production in the United States immediately. This will require reorganizing the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Energy Information Administration, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and Federal Emergency Management Agency to prepare for the clean energy economy and climate impacts to eliminate or transition resources and offices historically used to facilitate fossil fuel extraction, transportation, refining, and use. Instead, these agencies will lead a centralized taskforce to phase out fossil fuels by expediting research, development, deployment, and technical support for polluting industries to ensure a smooth transition for the workers and communities who have historically relied on fossil fuel production. This taskforce will be responsible not only for phasing out fossil fuel production on public lands and waters, but will support the end of fossil fuel production on private property as well. \n\nThe bottom line is that there is a climate emergency which demands a massive-scale mobilization to halt, reverse, and address its consequences and causes. As president, I will declare a national emergency on climate change and take immediate, large-scale action to reverse its effects. This is an existential threat and we will do whatever it takes to confront it.\n\nI will use executive authority to ban fossil fuel extraction on public lands, ban fracking and mountaintop removal coal mining, ban offshore drilling, ban imports and exports of all fossil fuels, end all new federal fossil fuel infrastructure permits, aggressively regulate greenhouse gas emissions, use regulations to help us decarbonize our transportation and energy sectors, rejoin and strengthen the Paris Climate Agreement, divest federal pensions from fossil fuels, and place a fee on imported carbon pollution-intensivegoods. As president, I will impose sanctions on corporations and entities that threaten national and global emissions reduction goals. \n\nI will also hold the fossil fuel industry accountable by suing and prosecuting corporations who knowingly contributed to climate change and require fossil fuel corporations repair leaking infrastructure, including natural gas and oil pipelines and drilling sites. I will pressure financial institutions, universities, insurance corporations, and large institutional investors still invested in or insuring fossil fuels to transition those investments to clean energy bonds through executive action. I will break up big agribusinesses that have a stranglehold on farmers and rural communities and negatively impact our environment, and enforce the Clear Air and Water Acts on large factory farms. And I will focus the federal government\'s resources, including procurement, on transitioning to a 100 percent clean energy economy. \n\nI will work with Congress to pass a comprehensive Green New Deal to create 20 million good-paying union jobs while meeting the IPCC emissions reductions targets and transforming our energy system and our economy.\n\nMy Green New Deal is not only a serious climate plan, but an opportunity to uproot historical injustices and inequities to advance social, racial, and economic justice, including redressing the exclusion of black, brown, Native American, and other vulnerable communities from the programs that made up the original New Deal.\n\nAs president, I will ensure an inclusive, comprehensive process from start to finish. Workers and communities on the frontline of fossil fuel extraction, transportation and use and those most vulnerable to climate impacts must be involved from the creation and implementation of regulations and protocols to the distribution of funds and carrying out the work of the Green New Deal. And we will follow the Principles of Environmental Justice adopted at the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit. The goals and outcomes of the Green New Deal should continue to be developed under the Jemez Principles for Democratic Organizing with strong and consistent consultation with the communities most affected by the currently unequal enforcement of environmental laws.\n\nI will ensure justice for frontline communities \u2013especially under-resourced groups, communities of color, Native Americans, people with disabilities, children and the elderly \u2013to recover from, and prepare for, the climate impacts, including through a $40 billion Climate Justice Resiliency Fund. And providing those frontline and fenceline communities a just transition including real jobs, resilient infrastructure, economic development. I will invest $238 billion to clean up Superfund sites and $150 billion to clean up and revitalize Brownfields, and other areas and communities that have been polluted by the fossil fuel, chemical and mining industries. We will spend $100 billion on fossil fuel well and mine cleanup. We will provide targeted regional economic development to communities especially in need of assistance during our transition to a clean energy economy. We will provide $130 billion for counties impacted by climate change with funding for water, broadband, and electric grid infrastructure investments. \n\nWe will extend civil rights protections to ensure full access to the courts for poor and minority communities to seek legal protections by overturning the Sandoval Supreme Court decision that set an unreasonable burden of proof of racism for claims of environmental racism, including disparate and cumulative exposure to environmental health risks. We will fully survey and track pollution in vulnerable communities, ensure the creation and implementation of the Green New Deal is accessible to people with disabilities and non-English speakers, ensure equitable hiring standards, expand nutrition and home energy assistance programs, and much more to ensure that environmental justice is front and center as we transition to a 100% sustainable economy. And this plan will prioritize the fossil fuel workers who have powered our economy for more than a century and who have too often been neglected by corporations and politicians. We will invest $1.3 trillion in a just transition to guarantee five years of a worker\u2019s current salary, housing assistance, job training, health care, pension support, and priority job placement for any displaced worker, as well as early retirement support for those who choose it or can no longer work.

But the climate crisis also represents an unprecedented opportunity to transition our economy to 100% clean energy, create millions of good paying, union jobs, unleash the best of American innovation and creativity and confront the racial and economic inequality embedded in our fossil fuel economy. A comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, which is what the Green New Deal demands, will be a top priority in my administration and will be reflected in the organization of my government, because we must meet the urgency of the moment.\n\nAs President, I will pursue an agenda of economic patriotism (https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/american-jobs), using new and existing tools to defend and create American jobs and promote American industry. I\u2019ve proposed to consolidate existing government programs that affect job creation into a new Department of Economic Development, with the sole responsibility to create and defend quality, sustainable American\njobs. This new Department will include research and development programs, worker training and retraining programs and export and trade authorities.\n\nMy Green Manufacturing Plan (https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/green-manufacturing) is the first example of economic patriotism in action, and part of how I\u2019ll implement my commitment to a Green New Deal. I have proposed to invest $2 trillion over ten years in clean energy technology made right here in America, including using the full power of the federal procurement process to purchase American-made clean, renewable, and emission-free energy products for federal, state, and local use. I\u2019ve proposed a Green Apollo Program that would invest $400 billion over ten years for clean energy research and development and I will create a National Institutes of Clean Energy, with provisions to ensure that taxpayers benefit from their research investments and that manufacturing stays in the United States. And I\u2019ve proposed a Green Marshall Plan, which includes a new federal office dedicated to selling American-made clean, renewable and emission-free energy technology abroad and $100 billion commitment to assist countries in purchasing and deploying this technology.\n\nI\u2019ve also proposed an ambitious set of reforms (https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/end-washington-corruption)  to end the corporate capture of our federal rulemaking. My plan restricts those who are eligible to participate in the rulemaking process so that industry no longer has an open door. It also closes the loopholes that have allowed industry and agencies to delay the implementation of rules they do not like, including by ending so-called informal review, reducing the review period to 45 days, and clarifying that only Appeals Courts \u2014 not individual Federal District judges \u2014 can temporarily block the implementation of rules. And my plan requires agencies to publicly justify the withdrawal of any public interest rules. My plan also establishes an Office of the Public Advocate to help the public engage with important legal changes made by federal agencies. And I\u2019ll allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against federal agencies for unnecessarily delaying or failing to enforce agency rules \u2014 and against corporations who have violated them.\n\nMy plan also calls for something unique \u2014 a new tax on excessive lobbying that applies to every corporation and trade organization that spends over $500,000 per year lobbying our government. This tax will direct a surge of resources to Congress and federal agencies to fight back when efforts to bury public interest actions are taken by the government. And I will mandate that all federal agencies consider climate impacts in their permitting and rulemaking.\n\nFor too long, Big Oil has been allowed to suck down billions of dollars in subsidies at the expense of the environment and working families. I support eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and using that money to invest in clean and renewable energy and infrastructure. I was the first 2020 candidate to sign the No Fossil Fuel Pledge and I fought against Trump nominees like David Bernhardt and Andrew Wheeler -- walking conflicts of interest with deep ties to the fossil fuel industry.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll work with Congress to overhaul the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is tasked with regulating the U.S. electrical grid, replacing it instead with a Federal Renewable Energy Commission. The revised commission\u2019s mission will be to reduce greenhouse gas pollution \u2014 and we\u2019ll slam shut the revolving door with industry to ensure it is responsive not to fossil fuel interests but to our communities."\n'}},{title:"Plan to hold decision-makers accountable",description:"Plan for confronting fossil fuel executives and decision makers to hold them accountable for wrongdoing.",total:"7",biden:{score:"3",analysis:"Vice President Biden\u2019s plans to hold fossil fuel corporations accountable involve enforcing some existing laws on the books through the EPA and DOJ, but he doesn\u2019t lay out any plans to actively prosecute or take on fossil fuel executives or other decisionmakers for criminal or civil liability and wrongdoing.",source:"The Biden campaign did not respond to our request for more information on his plan in this area.

For decades, fossil fuel corporations knowingly destroyed our planet for short-term profits. The fossil fuel industry has known since as early as the 1970s that their products were contributing to climate change and thatclimate change is real, dangerous, and preventable. Yet, they kept going. Instead of working to find solutions to the coming crisis, the fossil fuel industry poured billions into funding climate denialism, hiring lobbyists to fight even the slightest government regulation and oversight, and contributing to politicians who would put the interests of fossil fuel executives over the safety and security of the planet. Fossil fuel corporations have fought to escape liability for the pollution and destruction caused by their greed. They have evaded taxes, desecrated tribal lands, exploited workers and poisoned communities. I believe this is criminal activity, and, when I am President, I will hold the fossil fuel industry accountable.\n\nTransitioning to 100 percentrenewable energy cannot be done without standing up to fossil fuel corporations. I will make fossil fuel corporations pay for the irreparable damage they have done to our communities and our planet, and I will ensure that all fossil fuel workers affected by the transition are entitled to new jobs, health care, pensions, and wage support. I will not allow fossil fuel executives to reap massive profits while endangering the future of humanity. I will not leave it to the market to determine the fate of the planet. The science is clear on what is necessary. As president, I will take immediate action to end the fossil fuel industry\u2019s greed once and for all.\n\nAs president, I will prosecute and sue the fossil fuel industry for the damage it has caused. When it was revealed in 2015 that the fossil fuel industry knew their actions were contributing to climate change decades ago, I sent a letter to then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking her to open a federal investigation to find out whether the industry violated the law. I will ensure that my Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission investigate these companies and bring suits \u2014both criminal and civil \u2014for any wrongdoing, just as the federal government did with the tobacco industry in the 1980s. These corporations and their executives should not get away with hiding the truth from the American people. They should also pay damages for the destruction they have knowingly caused. We will also support state and regional action to determine the projected harm to communities and pave the way for actions that remunerate devastated communities requiring care and repair and the dollars to do it.\n\nI will make the fossil fuel industry pay for their pollution by massively raising taxes on corporate polluters\u2019 and investors\u2019 fossil fuel income and wealth. We will raise penalties on pollution from fossil fuel energy generation. The EPA has historically under-enforced the existing penalties for polluting under the Clean Air Act. As president, I will raise and aggressively enforce those penalties.\n\nAnd I will require remaining fossil fuel infrastructure owners to buy federal fossil fuel risk bonds to pay for disaster impacts at the local level. Federal risk bonds can then be paid to counties and municipalities when there are fossil fuel spills, explosions, or accidents.\n\nBut I want to be clear: coal miners and oil-rig operators are not the problem. Fossil fuel workers have powered the country for more than a century, working in dangerous and precarious jobs to provide for their families. They have given their lives on unsafe, under-regulated worksites, and they have seen their pensions get cut, their health care get stripped away, and their jobs disappear while fossil fuel executives rake in billions.\n\nFor too long, this country has neglected workers displaced by government policy. NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, which I opposed, eliminated millions of jobs and left entire communities devastated. I will put workers first. Full employment, economic opportunities and high-wage jobs in underserved areas will be supplemented by income, health care, education and pension protections. When we are in the White House, compensation and assistance for displaced workers will come first; the balance sheetsof fossil fuel corporations and billionaire investors will come last. We will invest $1.3 trillion in a just transition to guarantee five years of a worker\u2019s current salary, housing assistance, job training, health care, pension support, and priority job placement for any displaced worker, as well as early retirement support for those who choose it or can no longer work."'},warren:{score:"5",analysis:"While Senator Warren has a robust plan to ensure that we are using the full power of the federal government to hold polluters and corporate executives accountable for wrongdoing, including pressing for criminal charges on wrongdoing and her innovative plan to Fight Corporate Perjury, we\u2019d like to see her more explicitly committed to prosecuting fossil fuel executives and decision makers based on the clear and well-documented wrongdoing they have  committed in lying to and deceiving the public over the past decades, and making them pay for the damage they have done to society.",source:'In response to our request for her plan in this area, the Warren campaign sent the following:\n\n"As president, I will use all my authorities to hold companies accountable for their role in the climate crisis, including their role in ongoing, systemic environmental racism in frontline communities.

That means steep fines, which we will reinvest in impacted communities. And under my Corporate Executive Accountability Act, we\u2019ll press for criminal penalties for executives when their companies hurt people through criminal negligence.\n\nAdditionally, a Warren administration will use the power of the courts to hold polluters accountable for the damage they\u2019ve caused to our communities. I\u2019ll work with Congress tocreate a private right of action for environmental harm at the federal level, allowing individuals and communities impacted by environmental discrimination to sue for damages and hold corporate polluters accountable.\n\nBut it\u2019s not enough to just go after the fossil fuel industry. I will also hold the financial and insurance institutions that have been underwriting and funding the fossil fuel industry accountable because they are complicit in funding the climate crisis. In fact, since the Paris Agreement was signed, U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of America have actually increased their fossil fuel investments. My Climate Risk Disclosure plan (https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/clean-energy) requires companies to publicly disclose climate-related risks. It directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue rules that make every public company disclose detailed information, including the likely effect on the company if climate change continues at its current pace and the likely effect on the company if the world successfully restricts greenhouse gas emissions to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement. By requiring companies to price their exposure to climate risk into their valuations, we\u2019ll raise public awareness of just how dependent companies are on fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to clean energy. \n\nAnd for pollution that remains in the ground as \u201corphan\u201d toxic waste and continues to threaten our clean air and water I will reinstitute the Superfund Waste Tax, which expired after Big Oil and other industry lobbyists got the ear of Congress and the tax authority expired in 1995. Polluters must pay for the consequences of their actions - not leave them for the communities to clean up.

As president, I will declare a national emergency on climate change and take immediate, large-scale action to reverse its effects. This is an existential threat and we will do whatever it takes to confront it.\n\nThe federal government electrified America as part of the New Deal. The United States of America put people on the moon 50 years ago.We can sure as hell transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to 100 percent renewables today and create millions of jobs in the process. My Green New Deal directly invests an historic $16.3 trillion federal investment toward these efforts, in line with the mobilization of resources made during the New Deal and WWII, but with an explicit choice to include black, indigenous and other minority communities who were systematically excluded in the past. \n\nAs part of my Green New Deal, we will focus thefederal government\u2019s resources on transitioning to a 100 percent clean energy economy. In order to make the carbon pollution reductions required by the IPCC report, we must eliminate all new fossil fuel production in the United States immediately. This will require reorganizing the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Energy Information Administration, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and Federal Emergency Management Agency to prepare for the clean energy economy and climate impacts to eliminate or transition resources and offices historically used to facilitate fossil fuel extraction, transportation, refining, and use. Instead, these agencies will lead a centralized taskforce to phase out fossil fuels by expediting research, development, deployment, and technical support for polluting industries to ensure a smooth transition for the workers and communities who have historically relied on fossil fuel production. This taskforce will be responsible not only for phasing out fossil fuel production on public lands and waters, but will support the end of fossil fuel production on private property as well. \n\nThe urgency of our climate crisis demands the use of executive authority. I will use executive authority to ban fossil fuel extraction on public lands, ban fracking and mountaintop removal coal mining, ban offshore drilling, ban imports and exports of all fossil fuels, end all new federal fossil fuel infrastructure permits, aggressively regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions, use regulations to help us decarbonize our transportation and energy sectors, rejoin and strengthen the Paris Climate Agreement, divest federal pensions from fossil fuels, and place a fee on imported carbon pollution-intensive goods. As president, I will impose sanctions on corporations and entities that threaten national and global emissions reduction goals. \n\nI will also hold the fossil fuel industry accountable by suing and prosecuting corporations who knowingly contributed to climate change and require fossil fuel corporations repair leaking infrastructure, including natural gas and oil pipelines and drilling sites. I will pressure financial institutions, universities, insurance corporations, and large institutional investors still invested in or insuring fossil fuels to transition those investments to clean energy bonds through executive action. We will fully survey and track pollution in vulnerable communities. We will update permitting rules that allow polluters to target poor communities for polluting infrastructure. We will ensure the full and equal enforcement of all environmental, civil rights, and public health laws and aggressive prosecution of violators. I will break up big agribusinesses that have a stranglehold on farmers and rural communities and negatively impact our environment, and enforce the Clear Air and Water Acts on large factory farms. And I will focus the federal government\'s resources, including procurement, on transitioning to a 100 percent clean energy economy.\n\nAnd I will work with Congress to pass a comprehensive Green New Deal that uses the power of the federal government to create 20 million good-paying union jobs while meeting the IPCC emissions reductions targets and transforming our energy system and our economy.\n\nAs part of my Green New Deal, we will use the power of the federal government to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to 100 percent energy efficiency and sustainable energy by 2030 at the latest. The New Deal provided inexpensive electricityto America through efforts like the Rural Electrification Administration and the Federal Power Marketing Administrations. If the federal government was able to electrify America under FDR without computers or any of the modern technologies we have available to us today, think of what we can do today. Municipal and cooperative electric utilities still provide some of the least expensive electricity in the country today. As part of the Green New Deal, we will expand on that success to provide sustainable energy to every person in the country. We will spend $526 billion on a modern, high-volt, underground, renewable, direct current, smart, electric transmission and distribution grid to ensure our transition to 100 percent sustainable energy is safe and smooth.\n\nWe will use the power of the federal government to decarbonize our building sector by 2030 at the latest, investing $3.14 trillion to help low and moderate income families and small businesses weatherize and electrify their homes and businesses. We will invest $200 billion in the Green Climate Fund for the equitable transfer of renewable technologies, climate adaptation, and assistance in adopting sustainable energies to the Global South. U.S. leadership can ensure that the developing world secures reliable electricity, reduces poverty and pollution-related fatalities, creates greater net employment, and improves living standards \u2014all while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.

I will roll back all of Trump\u2019s disastrous pro-fossil fuels policies and reinstate Obama era environmental protections that protect the air we breathe and the water we drink. That includes reinstating the methane pollution rule to limit existing oil and gas projects from releasing harmful gases that poison our air and restoring the Clean Power Plan to put limits on carbon pollution emitted from our power plants. I will reinstitute the clean water rule to protect our lakes, rivers, and streams, and the drinking water they provide and I will make agribusinesses pay the full costs of the environmental damage they wreak by closing the loopholes they use to get away with polluting by beefing up enforcement of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. To safeguard our public lands and work towards a managed decline of fossil fuels, I will ban all new fossil fuel leases offshore and on public lands. And I will commit the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change, as a first step to leading the world in our collective effort to keep warming below 1.5 degrees celsius.\n\nI\u2019ll make combating climate change a key focus of our trade deals - and make sure America lives up to the same standards we hold other countries. I'll require countries we negotiate trade deals with to comply with the Paris Climate accord and end fossil fuel subsidies. I will also use our trade policy to promote environmental stewardship, protecting domestic subsidies for green products and preferential treatment for green energy production from WTO challenges, and imposing a border carbon adjustment on carbon-intensive imported goods.\n\nAs part of our commitment to addressing the climate crisis, we should end all American support for international oil and gas projects through the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. We should also commit to using America\u2019s voting power in the World Bank and other global financial institutions to cut off investment in fossil fuel projects and to direct that investment into clean energy projects instead. Our efforts should be dedicated to accelerating the global transition to clean energy.\n\nAs my administration works toward defeating the climate crisis, justice for communities at the front lines will not be a secondary concern - rather it will be at the center of our response to climate change. That\u2019s why under a Warren administration the Council on Environmental Quality will become the Council on Climate Action, with a new mandate to ensure justice is at the center of the administration's climate efforts and to elevate the voices of frontline and fenceline community leaders to the highest levels of our government.

We need to fight for big, structural change to take on the climate crisis and fight for an economy that works for\neverybody.\n\nA Green New Deal will only be implemented if we address the root of power for the well-connected fossil fuel industry: Corruption in our government. Washington works well for the fossil fuel industry, but not for Americans all across the country who are suffering from the impacts of climate change. We need big, structural change to tackle the climate crisis and that will start with fundamentally changing the way Washington does business. We must slam the revolving door shut between Big Oil and our federal agencies and get fossil fuel money out of politics. All of my plans come back to one simple idea: put economic and political power in the hands of the people.\n\nAs my administration works to implement a Green New Deal, I am also committed to building the power of political organizations that push our party and our country in a more progressive direction because we\u2019re all in this fight together. Our movement is united by the values we share. I have worked together with allies to help build a strong and extensive bench of progressive elected officials, staffers, organizers, and volunteer leaders who will make our movement successful in the long run, and am committed to continuing that work. We will build a government that reflects the values of the Green New Deal, which means elevating the voices of those who have traditionally been overlooked and underserved, like those in frontline communities who have historically been hit first and worst by climate change. We\u2019ve got to make sure everyone has a seat at the table. We will stand up for what\u2019s right and lay out our bold plans to fix what\u2019s broken.\n\nThe climate crisis is the existential threat of our time.

When the most deadly fire in California\u2019s history struck the town of Paradise last November, a majority of the victims were disabled or elderly. People with disabilities face increased difficulties in evacuation assistance and accessing critical medical care. For people who are homeless, disasters exacerbate existing challenges around housing and health. And fear of deportation can deter undocumented people from contacting emergency services for help evacuating or from going to an emergency shelter. As president, I will strengthen rules to require disaster response plans to uphold the rights of vulnerable populations. In my immigration plan, I committed to putting in place strict guidelines to protect sensitive locations, including emergency shelters. We\u2019ll also develop best practices at the federal level to help state and local governments develop plans for at-risk communities - including for extreme heat or cold - and require that evacuation services and shelters are fully accessible to people with disabilities. During emergencies, we will work to ensure that critical information is shared in ways that reflect the diverse needs of people with disabilities and other at-risk communities, including through ASL and Braille and languages spoken in the community. We will establish a National Commission on Disability Rights and Disasters, ensure that federal disaster spending is ADA compliant, and support people with disabilities in disaster planning. We will make certain that individuals have ongoing access to health care services if they have to leave their community or if there is a disruption in care.  And we will ensure that a sufficient number of disability specialists are present in state emergency management teams and FEMA\u2019s disaster response corps."\n\n"Ensure a just and equitable recovery. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, disaster scammers and profiteers swarmed, capitalizing on others\u2019 suffering to make a quick buck. And after George W. Bush suspended the Davis-Bacon Act, the doors were opened for contractors to under-pay and subject workers to dangerous working conditions, particularly low-income and immigrant workers.

But right now, transportation also accounts for the largest portion of U.S. carbon pollution. Moreover, our public transportation infrastructure is crumbling: the American Society of Civil Engineers gave our roads a \u201cD\u201d grade on their most recent infrastructure report card, with one out of every five miles of highway pavement in poor condition. \n\nFor too long, our government has failed to invest in critical infrastructure -- and unless we take action, poor conditions will continue to plague one of our most important industries. But this, too, is an opportunity: as we rebuild our crumbling transportation infrastructure, we can build in climate resiliency, and create a transportation system powered by electricity rather than fossil fuels. The massive project of investing in our transportation infrastructure will affect every state and county in the nation, creating about 2.6 million jobs in the public and private sector. \n\nBUILD GREEN PROGRAM\n\nPublic transportation is a $71 billion industry that employs more than 430,000 people. And yet, 45% of Americans still do not have access to public transportation, leaving those without access reliant on car ownership to get to work, school and worship. We know that increasing public transportation rates and decreasing vehicle miles traveled is one of the best ways to reduce emissions. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing a new Build Green program, which would establish a new grant program to electrify public buses, school buses, rail, cars, and fleet vehicles that is modeled after the Department of Transportation\u2019s BUILD grant program. This program will be paid for by closing corporate loopholes, and will open up new funding opportunities for states, cities, counties and tribal governments to expand and electrify public transportation options. A study conducted in the Twin Cities found Black, Asian-American, and Latinx commuters have longer commutes than white commuters. And people with disabilities face particular barriers in using and accessing public transportation. These investments will be crucial to ensuring equitable and accessible transportation for all. \n\n100% Clean Vehicles. Demand for passenger electric vehicles is growing at home and abroad -- but even though more and more people want electric vehicles, they still only account for around 1% of vehicles on the road. To spur auto manufacturing in this space, I have put forward a bold and ambitious goal to require all new light -and medium-duty vehicles sold by 2030 to be zero emission vehicles. We\u2019ll achieve this goal by investing in a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. By the end of the first term of a Warren administration, there will be a charging station at every rest stop in America. And this nation-wide network of charging infrastructure will begin to lay the groundwork for electrifying long-haul trucking, too. \n\nBut charging station infrastructure is only half the battle. Right now, consumers don\u2019t have enough access to vehicles. In 2011, there were only two mass market electric vehicles available to consumers -- and even now, the auto industry offers only fifteen models. While car manufacturers are already trying to meet growing demand, my investment in clean energy technology, including products designed for use in the electric vehicle supply chain, will further increase adoption of electric vehicles by making it easier for auto manufacturers to build the vehicles that consumers want. \n\nWe\'ve let our failure to take action destroy our transportation infrastructure for too long and a Warren administration will make sure that the Department of Transportation acts with the speed and scale necessary to address the climate challenges ahead of us. I will take executive action to require the Department of Transportation set performance management rules that require federal transportation investments to be accompanied by life-cycle analysis and reduction strategies for climate and other transportation related pollution." https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/green-jobs?fbclid=IwAR1xqhvy6nh7UH_OnQF_lt6CGYcKP6jeaGxnLwYPKizsTL3Jl2AfFdO7ufc'}},{title:"Transportation Infrastructure -  Provides investments, regulations, and buyback programs to achieve zero- emissions light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles.",description:"Provides investments, regulations, and buyback programs to achieve zero- emissions light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles.",total:"1",biden:{score:"0",analysis:"Vice President Biden\u2019s plan does include increased incentives and new regulations for electric vehicles but does not mention a buyback program for gas-powered vehicles.",source:'From https://joebiden.com/climate/\n\n"There are now one million electric vehicles on the road in the United States.
